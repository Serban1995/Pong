This is the classic Pong game made in 3D where I added a few things. You can 
play versus the AI or with a friend from the same keyboard by just checking 
a Boolean  variable that tells to the game with one is the AI or the player. You
need hit first the space key in order to start the game and after that it will 
play a short animation like a countdown before the ball will start moving and 
that will happen also when a gold is scored. I added a little VFX on the player 
prefabs to look like the engine has smoke out of it and when the ball hits 
a wall it will make a spark visual effect.
